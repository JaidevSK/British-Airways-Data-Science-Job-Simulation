# What I Learned?

I recently participated in British Airway's job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Data Science team at British Airways.
I worked on a project where I analysed customer insights and built predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour. I practiced my data analytics skills using a Jupyter Notebook and built my PowerPoing and communication skills by presenting insights a real-world context.
Doing this programme confirmed that I really enjoy working with data to provide business insights and I'm excited to apply these skills on a Data Science team at a company like British Airways.
